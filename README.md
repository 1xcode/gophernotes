# gophernotes - Go in Notebooks

`gophernotes` is a Go kernel for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and Apache Zeppelin notebooks.  Finally, we can have a reliable and maintained way to use Go interactively and code in the browser!  This project is part of the Gopher Gala 2016, and is based on some work by [motemen](https://github.com/motemen) on a REPL called [gore](https://github.com/motemen/gore) and based on a no longer maintained and self-described as limited ipython kernel call [iGo](https://github.com/takluyver/igo).

## Gopher Gala Status:

- ~~Rewrite of some of the gore functionality to process messages from the notebook.~~
- Implement more intuitive error handling in the notebook, test the suite of functionality in the Jupyter notebook.
