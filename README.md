# gophernotes - Go in Notebooks

`gophernotes` is a Go kernel for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and Apache Zeppelin notebooks.  Finally, we can have a reliable and maintained way to use Go interactively and code in the browser!  This project is part of the Gopher Gala 2016, and is based on some work by [motemen](https://github.com/motemen) on a REPL called [gore](https://github.com/motemen/gore).

## Status:

Working on a rewrite of some of the gore functionality to process messages from the notebook.
